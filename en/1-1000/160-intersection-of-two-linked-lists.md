## LeetCode description of "160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists"

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

![](../../images/examples/160.png)

The test cases are generated such that there are **no cycles** anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

### [Example 1]

![](../../images/examples/160_1.png)

**Input**: `listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5]`

**Output**: `Intersected at '8'`

### [Example 2]

![](../../images/examples/160_2.png)

**Input**: `intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4]`

**Output**: `Intersected at '2'`

### [Example 3]

![](../../images/examples/160_3.png)

**Input**: `listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5]`

**Output**: `No intersection`

### [Constraints]

- The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
- The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
- `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

**Follow up**: Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?

## Intuition

This is a typical "encounter" problem, and it is best to transform it into a real-life scenario to enhance understanding.

Suppose you are A, and you are pursuing B. The destination is school. On the way to school, the distance at the back is what you both have to go through, and the distance at the front is for each of you to go your own way. The node spacing is assumed to be one kilometer.

Now, one morning, you both finished breakfast at the same time and are going to ride your bike to school. And you have a goal: to meet B and chat with him/her for a few words. What will you do? (Take Example 1 as an example)

<details><summary>Click to view the answer</summary><p>
You must first calculate how many kilometers her home is farther from the school than your home, and then wait for her to walk these kilometers before setting off. As long as you have the same speed, you will definitely meet, and the node where you meet is the answer.

1. First calculate the number of nodes in the two linked lists A and B. The number of nodes in linked list A is `node_count_a`, and the number of nodes in linked list B is `node_count_b`.
2. If `node_count_b > node_count_a`, then perform `node = node.next` for `node_count_b - node_count_a` times on linked list B.
3. At this time, repeat `node = node.next` on the two linked lists until the same node is found or one of the linked lists has reached the end.
</p></details>

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. First calculate the number of nodes in the two linked lists A and B. The number of nodes in linked list A is `node_count_a`, and the number of nodes in linked list B is `node_count_b`.

	```python
	node_count_a = 0
	node_count_b = 0
	
	node = headA
	while node:
	    node_count_a += 1
	    node = node.next
	```

2. If `node_count_b > node_count_a`, then perform `node = node.next` for `node_count_b - node_count_a` times on linked list B.

	```python
	bigger = headA
	smaller = headB
	
	if node_count_b > node_count_a:
	    bigger = headB
	    smaller = headA
	
	for _ in range(abs(node_count_b - node_count_a)):
	    bigger = bigger.next
	```

3. At this time, repeat `node = node.next` on the two linked lists until the same node is found or one of the linked lists has reached the end.

	```python
	while bigger and smaller:
	    if bigger == smaller:
	        return bigger
	
	    bigger = bigger.next
	    smaller = smaller.next
	
	return None
	```
