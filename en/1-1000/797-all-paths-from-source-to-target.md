## LeetCode description of "797. All Paths From Source to Target"

Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

### [Example 1]

![](../../images/examples/797_1.jpg)

**Input**: `graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]`

**Output**: `[[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]`

**Explanation**: 

<p>There are two paths: 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3 and 0 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3.</p>


### [Example 2]

![](../../images/examples/797_2.jpg)

**Input**: `graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]`

**Output**: `[[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]`

### [Constraints]

- `n == graph.length`
- `2 <= n <= 15`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] < n`
- `graph[i][j] != i` (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
- All the elements of `graph[i]` are **unique**.
- The input graph is **guaranteed** to be a **DAG**.

## Pattern of "Depth-First Search"

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a classic graph traversal algorithm characterized by its **"go as deep as possible"** approach when exploring branches of a graph. Starting from the initial vertex, DFS follows a single path as far as possible until it reaches a vertex with no unvisited adjacent nodes, then backtracks to the nearest branching point to continue exploration. This process is implemented using **recursion** or an **explicit stack (iterative method)**, resulting in a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** search order. As a result, DFS can quickly reach deep-level nodes far from the starting point in unweighted graphs.

**Comparison with BFS**:

1. **Search Order**: DFS prioritizes depth-wise exploration, while Breadth-First Search (BFS) expands layer by layer, following a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** queue structure.
2. **Use Cases**: DFS is better suited for strongly connected components or backtracking problems (e.g., finding all paths in a maze), whereas BFS excels at finding the shortest path (in unweighted graphs) or exploring neighboring nodes (e.g., friend recommendations in social networks).

**Unique Aspects of DFS**:

- **Incompleteness**: If the graph is infinitely deep or contains cycles (without visited markers), DFS may fail to terminate, whereas BFS always finds the shortest path (in unweighted graphs).
- **"One-path deep-dive"** search style makes it more flexible for backtracking, pruning, or path recording, but it may also miss near-optimal solutions.

In summary, DFS reveals the vertical structure of a graph through its depth-first strategy. Its inherent backtracking mechanism, combined with the natural use of a stack, makes it highly effective for path recording and state-space exploration. However, precautions must be taken to handle cycles and the potential absence of optimal solutions.

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. Initialize an empty list `paths` to store all valid paths found.
2. Initialize a stack to manage the DFS traversal. Each element on the stack will store a pair (or tuple) containing the current `node` and the `path` taken to reach that node.
3. Push the starting state onto the stack: the initial node `0` and an empty path list (e.g., `(0, [])`).
4. While the stack is not empty:
    - Pop the top element from the stack, retrieving the current `node` and its associated `path`.
    - Create a `currentPath` list by appending the current `node` to the `path` popped from the stack. This represents the path leading up to and including the current node.
    - Check if the current `node` is the target node (`n - 1`, where `n` is the total number of nodes).
        - If it is the target node, add the `currentPath` to the `paths` list, as a complete path from source to target has been found.
        - If it is not the target node, iterate through all `neighbor` nodes accessible from the current `node` (i.e., iterate through `graph[node]`).
            - For each `neighbor`, push a new pair onto the stack: the `neighbor` node and the `currentPath`. This prepares the traversal to explore paths extending from the neighbor.
5. After the loop finishes (stack is empty), return the `paths` list containing all discovered paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`.

However, precautions must be taken to handle cycles and the potential absence of optimal solutions.

## Pattern of "Recursion"

Recursion is an important concept in computer science and mathematics, which refers to the method by which a function calls itself **directly or indirectly** in its definition.

### The core idea of ​​recursion

- **Self-call**: A function calls itself during execution.
- **Base case**: Equivalent to the termination condition. After reaching the base case, the result can be returned without recursive calls to prevent infinite loops.
- **Recursive step**: The step by which the problem gradually approaches the "base case".

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. Initialize an empty list `paths` to store all the valid paths found from source to target.
2. Define a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) function, say `dfs`, that takes the current `node` and the `currentPath` (a list of nodes visited so far to reach the current node) as input.
3. Inside the `dfs` function:
    a. Create a new path list by appending the current `node` to the `currentPath`. Let's call this `newPath`.
    b. Check if the current `node` is the target node (`n - 1`, where `n` is the total number of nodes).
        i. If it is the target node, it means we've found a complete path. Add `newPath` to the main `paths` list and return from this recursive call.
    c. If the current `node` is not the target node, iterate through all `neighbor` nodes accessible from the current `node` (i.e., iterate through `graph[node]`).
        i. For each `neighbor`, make a recursive call to `dfs` with the `neighbor` as the new current node and `newPath` as the path taken to reach it (`dfs(neighbor, newPath)`).
4. Start the process by calling the `dfs` function with the source node `0` and an empty initial path (`dfs(0, [])`).
5. After the initial `dfs` call completes, return the `paths` list containing all discovered paths.

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. Initialize an empty list `paths` to store all valid paths found from the source to the target.
2. Create a mutable list `path` to track the current path being explored, initially containing only the source node `0`.
3. Implement a recursive DFS function that explores paths using backtracking:
    - Base case: If the current node is the target node (`n-1`), make a copy of the current path and add it to the `paths` list.
    - Recursive step: For each neighbor of the current node:
        - Add the neighbor to the current path.
        - Recursively call the DFS function with this neighbor.
        - After the recursive call returns, remove the neighbor from the path (backtrack).
4. Start the DFS from the source node `0`.
5. Return the collected `paths` after the DFS completes.
